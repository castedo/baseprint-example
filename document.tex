This example demonstrates source files which are used to generate a baseprint from which
web pages and PDF files can be rendered.
This example also demonstrates a file organization for use with Overleaf and other LaTeX
compilers.

\section{Introduction}

\label{intro}

This example of automated baseprint and web page and PDF preview genration is heavily
inspired by manubot \cite{himmelstein_open_2019}.

\section{Use with Overleaf and other LaTeX compilers}

This example can be used as source for generating a baseprint but also source for
LaTeX compilers, such as on Overleaf.

Use {\it main.tex} as the source file for traditional LaTeX compilers.
This file includes {\it document.tex} which is the source file used to generate a
baseprint.
